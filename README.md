# SAvantage: Analyzing Production Downtime

## Project Overview
This repository contains my successful data analysis project focused on optimizing production lines in a manufacturing environment. The goal was to identify bottlenecks causing low production capacity and inability to meet sales demand. By analyzing 90 days of maintenance data (2,160 hours of operations), I pinpointed excessive downtime as the core issue, particularly on the SA production line.

Through detailed metrics calculation, Pareto analysis, and root cause investigation using Excel, the project succeeded in uncovering actionable insights. This analysis not only highlighted the problems but also demonstrated clear paths to improvement, potentially boosting SA line availability from 80.86% to 95%+ and increasing overall production capacity by up to 20%.

## Repository Contents
- **Project Overview**: High-level summary of the business problem, questions, metrics, and data details.
- **Insights.pdf**: Visual insights and charts from the analysis.
- **Work File**: The core Excel workbook with calculations, dashboards, and measures (e.g., MTBF, MTTR, Availability, Pareto chart).
- **SAvantage Analyzing Production Downtime.pdf**: Full presentation report summarizing the analysis, findings, and recommendations.

## How to Explore
1. Download the files.
2. Open `Work File` in Excel to interact with the dashboard (e.g., view Pareto chart for SA line).
3. Review the PDF report for a complete walkthrough.

## Technologies Used
- Excel for data processing, metrics and interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- Pareto analysis for prioritization.
